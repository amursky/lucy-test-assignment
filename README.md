# Test assignment for «Lucy in the Sky»

## Setup

The project uses `yarn workspaces`, so you need to have `yarn` installed globally before going further.

```bash
npm i -g yarn
yarn bootstrap
```

## Run in production mode

```bash
yarn start
```

## Run in development mode (watch files for changes)

```bash
yarn start:dev
```
